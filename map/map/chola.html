    <p class="text">The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva.[3][4] It is one of the largest South Indian temples and an exemplary example of fully realized Tamil architecture.[5] Built by Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD. The original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnvaism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century
